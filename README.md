# Ansible Role Template

This is an template repo I intend to use for my Ansible roles. It's packed with some default content.

Here is how to use it:

- Clone this repo to your local machine: `$ git clone git@github.com:wahidsadik/ansible-role-template.git <new-role>`. Here _<new-role>_ is the name of your new role.
- Next: `$ cd <new-role>`
- Remove the `.git` directory to have a fresh start: `$ rm -rf .git`
- Replace the word _tbd_ in the following files with _<new-role>_:
  - README-rename-me.md
  - tests/test.yml
- Delete this file (README.md) and rename README-rename-me.md to README.md.
- Done!
